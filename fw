When working on *nix:
- Unpack PKG in PKG (nested PKG): pkgutil --expand-full
- Find recursively in files: grep -r "PeiMain" .
- Mass download pages: wget --recursive --no-parent <url>

Online Disassemble unreal mode:

PEI = pre efi initialization
PEIM = PEI module
PPI = PEIM to PEIM interface
==> pre efi initialization module to pre efi initialization module interface

MTRR mask = MAXPHYSADDR - (top_of_range - base_of_range)

SMRR (IVB)...
mov rcx, 0x1f2
rdmsr (base in EDX:EAX)

mov rcx, 0x1f3
rdmsr (mask in EDX:EAX)

TSEG = Top Segment (== SMRAM?)

STM = Secure Transfer Monitor
MSEG = Monitor Segment

TSEGMB = TOLUD - STOLEN - TSEG
GTT = graphics translation table?
SA = System Agent = Uncore (Related to or same as NB) (Resides in processor die)
IMC = integrated memory controller
MRC = Memory Reference Code
QPI = QuickPath Interconnect
IED = Intel Enhanced Debug? (There is e.g. "IEDBASE")

CRB = Customer Reference Board

AP = Application Processor
BSP = Bootstrap Processor

SPI = serial peripheral interface

PCI = peripheral component interconnect:
- positive decode: device claims transaction if transaction within one of its BARs
- subtractive decode: device claims if no other device claims irrespectively of transaction target address

ME:
GLUT = Global lookup table

Whereis?:
- SPIBAR, BIOS_CNTL (SMM_BWP, BLE, BIOSWE, (TSS)) ==> See datasheets of PCH (SB)
- MSRs (SMRR, SMBASE, ) ==> See Intel SDMs
- MCHBAR, G_SMRAME, D_LCK, & co. (!) ==> See datasheets of CPU (CPU & NB (Uncore aka SA)) (though not for 2nd and 3nd gen Intel Core(R)?)
- IEDBASE ==> ??
